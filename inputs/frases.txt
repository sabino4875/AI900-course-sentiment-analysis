Great product and price!
Waaay too small. Will use for futur children!
My son really likes the pink. Ones which I was nervous about
Relieved my Plantar Fascitis for 3 Days. Then the unbearable pain returned in full force. These were recommended by my Podiatrist.
This is my 6th pair and they are the best thing ever for my plantar fasciitis and resultant neuromas. Unfortunately, the ones I ordered from SmartDestination must be seconds as they kill my feet. The hard plastic insert rubs on the outside edges of my feet. I am unable to exchange them as I waited one day too late to use them in my walking shoes.
I only give four stars because the pants have no pockets.
Was terribly disappointed, the pants were way too large in the legs, my husband looked like he was wearing blown up clown pants.
Constantly rolls down
Sadly, not a true red. It's definitely orange
For the price I spent on the pair of shoes, I'd say it's as good as expected.\nIt's comfortable and doesn't hurt my feet when I run.
